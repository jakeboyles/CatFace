# CatFace

An quick HTML5 Canvas experiment that was built as a gag to allow people to easily add faces on top of images of cats. The images can then be saved using a simple PHP script. 



Todo: 

- JS is super simple, needs to be refactored. ( Thrown together quickly )
- The save image feature is bonked, fix this.
